- No-code configuration eliminates development complexity [2]
- Pre-built SharePoint integration leverages existing GEMADEPT infrastructure [3]

**Cost Efficiency:**
- $30 annual technology cost vs. $5,000-15,000 for open source development [4]
- Minimal technical resources required (1 SharePoint admin vs. ML engineering team) [5]
- Proven ROI with verified Microsoft pricing at $0.005/page [6]

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Established enterprise platform with Microsoft support [7]
- Vietnamese language processing capabilities built-in [8]
