## Investment Decision Matrix

| Technology | Annual Cost | Deployment Time | Best For |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Microsoft Syntex** | $30-130 | 6-12 weeks | Standard forms, fastest start |
| **Power Automate** | $180-2,000 | 2-4 weeks | Simple rules, existing M365 |
| **Logic Apps** | $300-1,300 | 8-16 weeks | Complex workflows, enterprise scale |
| **Custom Solution** | $5,000-15,000 | 6-12 months | Specialized requirements |

**Recommendation:** Start with Microsoft Syntex pilot due to minimal cost and risk.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot (2 months, $130 cost)
- Test 200 documents across GEMADEPT's 12 document types
- Measure actual automation rates and user acceptance
- **Go/No-Go Decision Point:** If <25% automation achieved, terminate project

### Phase 2: Rollout (4 months, $30/year ongoing)
- Deploy across all 3,000 annual documents
- Train staff on new processes
- Monitor performance and adjust

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Low adoption** | Reduces savings to $400-600 | Comprehensive training program |
| **Technology failure** | $130 lost investment | Pilot testing validates before full deployment |
| **Integration issues** | Delays deployment | Staged rollout with IT support |

**Maximum downside:** $130 pilot cost if project fails completely.

## Decision Recommendation

**Approve pilot immediately** based on:
- Minimal financial risk ($130 pilot cost)
- Significant upside potential ($840+ annual savings)
- No long-term commitment required
- Immediate termination possible if results unsatisfactory

**Success metrics for pilot:**
- 25%+ automation rate achieved
- 70%+ user adoption
- Processing time reduced by 50%+

**Timeline for decision:** Results available in 2 months, full deployment by month 6.
