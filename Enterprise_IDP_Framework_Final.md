## Automation Rate Methodology (Evidence-Based)

### Realistic Automation Formula

```
Overall Automation Rate = Classification Accuracy × Field Extraction Success × Adoption Rate

Where:
- Classification Accuracy: Must be measured per document type in pilot
- Field Extraction Success: ∏(Coverage_i × Precision_i) for required fields
- Adoption Rate: User acceptance and training effectiveness factor
```

**Critical Assumptions to Test:**
1. **Field Independence:** OCR/layout errors often affect multiple fields simultaneously
2. **Document Mix Consistency:** Production documents match pilot sample quality
3. **No Performance Drift:** Model accuracy remains stable over time

### Sample Calculation with Sensitivity Analysis

**Base Case:**
- Classification accuracy: 85%
- Date field success: 90% × 85% = 76.5%
- Amount field success: 80% × 80% = 64%
- Combined field success: 76.5% × 64% = 48.96%
- Adoption rate: 80%
- **Total automation: 85% × 48.96% × 80% = 33.3%**

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
| Field Accuracy Change | Overall Automation Rate | Impact |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Base case | 33.3% | - |
| -5% per field | 26.1% | -21.6% |
| -10% per field | 19.8% | -40.5% |
| +5% per field | 42.0% | +26.1% |

## Deployment Timeline (Evidence-Based)

### Microsoft Syntex Deployment

**Optimal Conditions (2-4 weeks):**
- Existing SharePoint environment configured
- Labeled training data available (minimum 5 samples per document type)
- Standard document types (invoices, contracts, receipts)
- Minimal IT approval processes

**Realistic Conditions (6-12+ weeks):**
- Custom document types requiring model training
- IT governance and security approvals needed
- User training and change management required
- Integration with existing business processes

**GEMADEPT-Specific Factors:**
- 12 document types requiring separate model training
- Vietnamese language content may require additional validation
- Logistics industry compliance requirements
- Port operations integration complexity

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Pilot Validation (4-8 weeks)**
```
Week 1-2: Document sampling and quality assessment
├── Collect 185+ documents per type (2,220 total minimum)
├── Assess document quality spectrum (scans, handwritten, mixed language)
├── Identify regulatory/compliance requirements
└── Establish baseline processing metrics

Week 3-4: Technology setup and initial testing
├── Configure Azure subscription and SharePoint integration
├── Train initial Syntex models with sample documents
├── Test with subset of documents across quality spectrum
└── Measure processing accuracy and identify edge cases

Week 5-6: Validation and measurement
├── Process full pilot sample through trained models
├── Calculate confusion matrices per document type

└── Present findings to stakeholders
```

**Phase 2: Selective Deployment (8-16 weeks)**
- Deploy to highest-value document types first
- Establish user training and support processes
- Monitor adoption and accuracy metrics
- Refine models based on production feedback

**Phase 3: Full Scale (16-24+ weeks)**

## Sample Size and Statistical Validation

### Required Sample Size Calculation

**Formula Verification:**
```
n = (Z² × p × (1-p)) / e²

For 95% confidence (Z=1.96), 7% margin of error (e=0.07), p=0.5:
n = (3.8416 × 0.25) / 0.0049 = 0.9604 / 0.0049 = 196

Finite population correction (N=3,000):
n_adjusted = 196 / (1 + 195/3,000) = 196 / 1.065 = 184 → 185 documents
```

**Stratified Sampling Requirements:**
- Minimum 185 documents per document type for statistical validity
- Total minimum sample: 2,220 documents (185 × 12 types)
- Include quality spectrum: high-quality scans, poor scans, handwritten annotations
- Temporal distribution: documents from different time periods
