## Automation Rate Methodology with Sensitivity Analysis

### Formula with Explicit Assumptions

```
Overall Automation Rate = Classification Accuracy × Field Extraction Success × Adoption Rate

Where:
- Classification Accuracy: Measured per document type in pilot
- Field Extraction Success: ∏(Coverage_i × Precision_i) for all required fields
- Adoption Rate: User acceptance factor (70-90% typical)
```

### Critical Assumptions Requiring Pilot Validation

1. **Field Independence:** Assumes OCR/layout errors don't correlate across fields
2. **Document Mix Consistency:** Production quality matches pilot sample
3. **No Performance Drift:** Model accuracy remains stable over time
4. **User Behavior:** Staff follow new automated processes consistently

### Sensitivity Analysis Table

| Field Accuracy Change | Classification Impact | Overall Automation Rate | Relative Change |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Base Case** | 85% | 33.3% | - |
| **-10% per field** | 76.5% | 19.8% | -40.5% |
| **-5% per field** | 80.3% | 26.1% | -21.6% |
| **+5% per field** | 89.3% | 42.0% | +26.1% |
| **+10% per field** | 93.5% | 51.8% | +55.6% |

**Interpretation:** Small changes in field-level accuracy create large impacts on overall automation rate. Pilot testing is essential to validate assumptions.

## Implementation Timeline (Evidence-Based)

### Microsoft Syntex Deployment Conditions

**Optimal Timeline (2-4 weeks):**
- Existing SharePoint environment properly configured
- Labeled training data available (minimum 5 samples per document type)
- Standard document formats (invoices, contracts, receipts)
- Minimal IT governance and approval processes

**Realistic Timeline (6-12 weeks):**
- Custom document types requiring model training
- IT security reviews and compliance approvals
- User training and change management programs
- Integration with existing GEMADEPT business processes

**GEMADEPT-Specific Factors Adding Complexity:**
- 12 distinct document types requiring separate models
- Vietnamese language content requiring validation
- Logistics industry regulatory compliance
- Port operations integration requirements

### Phased Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Pilot Validation (6-8 weeks)**
- Document collection: 185+ samples per type (2,220+ total)
- Model training and initial accuracy measurement
- User acceptance testing with small group
- Cost and time validation against projections

**Phase 2: Selective Deployment (8-12 weeks)**
- Deploy to highest-ROI document types first
- Establish training and support processes
- Monitor adoption rates and accuracy metrics
- Refine processes based on feedback

**Phase 3: Full Scale (12-16 weeks)**
- Complete rollout across all document types
- Establish ongoing maintenance procedures
- Implement performance monitoring dashboards
- Plan for continuous improvement cycles

## Statistical Validation Requirements

### Sample Size Calculation (Verified)

**Formula Application:**
```
n = (Z² × p × (1-p)) / e²
Where: Z=1.96 (95% confidence), e=0.07 (±7% margin), p=0.5 (conservative)

Step-by-step calculation:
- Z² = 1.96² = 3.8416
- p(1-p) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25
- Numerator = 3.8416 × 0.25 = 0.9604
- e² = 0.07² = 0.0049
- n = 0.9604 / 0.0049 = 196 (unadjusted)

Finite population correction (N=3,000):
n_adjusted = 196 / (1 + 195/3,000) = 196 / 1.065 = 184 → 185 documents
```

**Stratified Sampling Requirements:**
- Minimum 185 documents per document type for statistical validity
- Quality spectrum coverage: excellent, average, and poor document samples
- Temporal distribution: documents from different time periods
- User variety: samples from different departments and uploaders
