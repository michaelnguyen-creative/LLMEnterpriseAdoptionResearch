## üìÑ **Report: Approaches for Document Classification & Metadata Extraction**

This report outlines the available approaches for document classification and metadata extraction, especially in the context of SharePoint and enterprise systems. It compares Microsoft Syntex, SharePoint + Power Automate, SharePoint + Logic Apps, Azure Cognitive Services, and Open-source NLP stacks. The goal is to evaluate their rationality, use cases, and scenarios where each fits best.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Technology Options Overview**

### **1. Microsoft Syntex**
**Rationality:** Choose when speed-to-value is more important than engineering control. Designed for organizations already on Microsoft 365, with business teams who can configure without coding.

**Use Cases:**
‚Ä¢ Invoices, receipts, contracts (structured/semi-structured forms)
‚Ä¢ HR, legal, procurement documents (classification + metadata extraction)

**Scenarios:**
‚Ä¢ Enterprise already licensed with M365 E3/E5
‚Ä¢ Business unit wants to test document automation within weeks, not months
‚Ä¢ Budget tolerates per-user subscription or pay-as-you-go billing

### **2A. SharePoint + Power Automate**
**Rationality:** Good when you want to leverage existing license entitlements and keep costs minimal. Provides rule-based and flow-based automation; extensible with connectors.

**Use Cases:**
‚Ä¢ Basic doctype classification (via file properties, naming, keywords)
‚Ä¢ Metadata enrichment with regex or calling external APIs (Azure AI, OpenAI)
‚Ä¢ Simple document approval workflows
‚Ä¢ Departmental document processing (HR, Finance)

**Scenarios:**
‚Ä¢ Organization has small pilot (few thousand documents)
‚Ä¢ Needs quick PoC using existing IT resources
‚Ä¢ Complexity is low - rules/flows sufficient
‚Ä¢ Business users need to build and maintain workflows themselves

### **2B. SharePoint + Logic Apps**
**Rationality:** Enterprise-grade workflow orchestration with robust monitoring and error handling. Best for IT-managed solutions at scale.

**Use Cases:**
‚Ä¢ Complex multi-step document processing workflows
‚Ä¢ High-volume batch processing (thousands of documents daily)
‚Ä¢ Integration with external systems and APIs
‚Ä¢ Enterprise compliance and audit requirements

**Scenarios:**
‚Ä¢ Enterprise-wide deployment across multiple business units
‚Ä¢ Need for sophisticated error handling and monitoring
‚Ä¢ Integration with Azure services and third-party systems
‚Ä¢ IT department managing and maintaining workflows

### **3. Azure Cognitive Services / AI Search**
**Rationality:** Choose when documents are unstructured or noisy and require pretrained AI models (OCR, entity recognition, address parsing). API-first approach makes it easy to integrate into existing applications.

**Use Cases:**
‚Ä¢ Postal address classification (NER)
‚Ä¢ Multi-language document processing
‚Ä¢ Extracting people, places, organizations, addresses, key phrases

**Scenarios:**
‚Ä¢ Organization has cloud developers available
‚Ä¢ Pilot needs higher accuracy on free-text fields
‚Ä¢ Long-term plan involves scaling to 100k+ documents with predictable per-transaction billing

### **4. Open-source NLP Stack (spaCy, Haystack, custom ML)**
**Rationality:** Choose when you need maximum flexibility and control, and you have engineering bandwidth. Avoids vendor lock-in and per-transaction API costs.

**Use Cases:**
‚Ä¢ Highly domain-specific metadata extraction
‚Ä¢ Custom classifiers (e.g., logistics bills of lading, port operation forms)
‚Ä¢ Integration into internal DMS beyond SharePoint

**Scenarios:**
‚Ä¢ Tech team can maintain ML/NLP pipelines
‚Ä¢ Large volume of documents makes API costs prohibitive
‚Ä¢ Willing to invest more upfront engineering effort to save long-term costs

## üìä **Feasibility Assessment Framework**

### **% Automation Estimation Methodology**

**Classification Accuracy Metrics:**
- **Precision (P):** In documents system reports as class X, what % are correct
- **Recall (R):** In documents actually class X, what % does system find
- **F1 Score:** 2 √ó P √ó R / (P + R)

**Extraction Coverage Metrics:**
- **Coverage:** % documents with field populated (not empty) after extraction
- **Precision_extr:** In extracted values, what % are correct (exact/normalized match)
- **Recall_extr:** In actual values present in docs, what % does system find

**Overall Automation Formula:**
```
% Automation ‚âà Classification_Accuracy √ó Fields_Extraction_Success

Where Fields_Extraction_Success = ‚àè(Coverage_i √ó Precision_i) for required fields
```

**Sample Calculation:**
- Classification accuracy: 90%
- Field 1 (Date): Coverage 95% √ó Precision 90% = 85.5%
- Field 2 (Amount): Coverage 80% √ó Precision 85% = 68%
- Combined field success: 85.5% √ó 68% = 58.14%
- **Total automation: 90% √ó 58.14% = 52.3%**

### **Confidence Interval & Sample Size**

**Required Sample Size (95% confidence, ¬±7% margin):**
```
n = (z¬≤ √ó p √ó (1-p)) / e¬≤
Where: z=1.96, p=0.5 (conservative), e=0.07

For finite population N=3,000: n_adjusted ‚âà 185 documents
```

**Confidence Interval for Results:**
```
CI = p ¬± z √ó ‚àö(p(1-p)/n)
Example: 90% accuracy with n=200 ‚Üí CI: (85.8%, 94.2%)
```

### **Time & Effort Estimation**

**Linear Scaling Formula:**
```
Time = (Pilot_time / Sample_size) √ó Total_files √ó Edge_case_factor

Example: Pilot 50 files = 4h
Scale to 3,000: (4h/50) √ó 3,000 √ó 1.2 = 288h
```

**Resource Requirements:**
| Phase | Duration | Effort | Complexity |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| Pilot (100 docs) | 4-8 hours | 1 engineer | Medium |
| Full scale (3,000 docs) | 240-300 hours | 1-2 engineers | Medium-High |
| Integration | 16-32 hours | 1-2 engineers | Medium |
