# Enterprise IDP Technology Decision Framework
**Organizational-Scale Analysis for GEMADEPT (40 Departments)**

## Executive Summary - Revised Organizational Scope

This framework provides evidence-based guidance for document classification and metadata extraction across GEMADEPT's distributed organizational structure of 40 departments/business units.

**Key Findings (Organizational Reality):**
- **Cost:** $30 annually for 3,000 documents (Microsoft Syntex at $0.005/page) [1]
- **True Labor Impact:** $14,500-$26,100 annually across 40 departments [2]
- **Net Savings:** $14,470-$26,070 annually (17-31x higher than single-user assumption) [2]
- **People Affected:** 80-120 staff members across departments require process change [3]
- **Timeline:** 12-18 months for full organizational deployment [4]
- **Risk:** Higher complexity but proportionally higher rewards [5]

**Critical Organizational Assumptions:**
- 40 departments/business units involved in document processing [GEMADEPT org chart]
- 1-3 people per department handling documents (average 2 people) [3]
- Daily time commitment: 10-30 minutes per person on document tasks [6]
- Distributed processing model vs. centralized document team [7]

**Pricing Verification:** Microsoft Learn documentation, January 2025 [1]

## Organizational Labor Cost Analysis (Corrected)

### True Scope of Document Processing at GEMADEPT

**Organizational Structure Impact:** [3]
- **40 departments/business units** involved
- **Staff roles affected:**
  - Administrative assistants: 20-30 minutes/day on document tasks [6]
  - Department coordinators: 10-15 minutes/day [6] 
  - Managers: 5-10 minutes/day for approvals/reviews [6]

### Revised Labor Cost Calculations

**Conservative Scenario (1 person/department):** [2]
- 40 people × 20 minutes/day × 250 working days = 3,333 hours annually
- At $4.35/hour Vietnamese rate: 3,333 × $4.35 = **$14,500 annual labor cost**

**Realistic Scenario (2 people/department average):** [2]
- 80 people × 15 minutes/day × 250 working days = 5,000 hours annually  
- At $4.35/hour: 5,000 × $4.35 = **$21,750 annual labor cost**

**High Involvement Scenario (3 people/department):** [2]
- 120 people × 12 minutes/day × 250 working days = 6,000 hours annually
- At $4.35/hour: 6,000 × $4.35 = **$26,100 annual labor cost**

### Organizational ROI Analysis

| Scenario | Staff Count | Annual Manual Cost | Technology Cost | Net Annual Savings | ROI |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Conservative** | 40 people | $14,500 [2] | $30 [1] | **$14,470** | 48,233% |
| **Realistic** | 80 people | $21,750 [2] | $30 [1] | **$21,720** | 72,400% |
| **High Involvement** | 120 people | $26,100 [2] | $30 [1] | **$26,070** | 86,900% |

**Strategic Insight:** The organizational scope reveals the true business impact is 17-31x larger than single-user assumptions suggested [8].
