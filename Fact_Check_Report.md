# Fact-Check Report: Enterprise IDP Framework
**Source Verification and Corrections Required**

## Executive Summary

**Status:** Multiple pricing inaccuracies identified requiring immediate correction
**Key Issue:** Microsoft Syntex pricing claims were overstated, affecting ROI calculations
**Action Required:** Update framework with verified pricing and add scenario tables

---

## Verified Facts (Evidence-Based)

### Microsoft Syntex Pricing ✅ VERIFIED
- **Current Rate:** $0.005 per transaction/page
- **Source:** Microsoft Learn - Pay-as-you-go pricing documentation
- **Calculation:** 6,000 pages × $0.005 = $30.00 annually
- **Status:** Correctly used in final framework

### Vietnamese Labor Costs ✅ VERIFIED  
- **Rate:** $4.35/hour (~$697/month average)
- **Source:** Time Doctor salary surveys
- **Calculation:** $697/month ÷ 160 hours = $4.35/hour
- **Status:** Accurately applied to GEMADEPT context

### Sample Size Calculation ✅ VERIFIED
- **Formula:** n = (1.96² × 0.25) / 0.07² = 196 (unadjusted)
- **Finite Population:** 196 / (1 + 195/3000) = 184 → 185 documents
- **Status:** Mathematically correct

### Automation Rate Methodology ✅ METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND
- **Formula:** Classification × Field Success × Adoption Rate
- **Industry Validation:** Supported by ABBYY and Gartner IDP reports
- **Caveat:** Requires explicit assumptions and sensitivity analysis

## Critical Corrections Required

### 1. Remove Historical Pricing References ❌ INCORRECT
**Problem:** Earlier framework versions contained outdated $0.01/$0.10 per page figures
**Correction:** Use only current $0.005/transaction rate with source citation
**Impact:** Prevents cost overestimation by 10x factor

### 2. Azure Subscription Setup Cost ❌ MISLEADING
**Problem:** Document claimed "$0-$50 setup cost"
**Correction:** "No mandatory setup fee; new accounts can use free trial credits"
**Source:** Microsoft Azure account creation documentation

### 3. Promotional Capacity Claims ⚠️ NEEDS SPECIFICATION
**Problem:** Generic "100 pages free" statement
**Correction:** "Limited monthly capacity for specific services (OCR, autofill, image tagging) through Dec 2025"
**Source:** Microsoft promotional documentation

---

## Required Framework Updates

### Immediate Corrections

**Syntex Pricing Section:**
```
Microsoft Syntex (pay-as-you-go): $0.005 per transaction (page)
Source: Microsoft Learn documentation (verified January 2025)
Annual cost for 6,000 pages: $30.00
```

**Azure Setup Section:**
```
No mandatory setup fee to create Azure subscription
New accounts can use free trial credits
All costs are consumption-based
```

### Enhanced ROI Analysis Required

**Multi-Scenario Table Needed:**
| Labor Market | Hourly Rate | Annual Manual Cost | Annual Savings | Net Benefit |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Vietnam Admin | $4.35 | $1,087.50 | $870 | $840 |
| Regional Professional | $10.00 | $2,500 | $2,000 | $1,970 |
| Western Contractor | $50.00 | $12,500 | $10,000 | $9,970 |

### Assumptions Documentation Required

**Explicit Assumptions Box:**
- Field independence (errors don't correlate across fields)
- Document mix stability (production matches pilot sample)
- No model accuracy drift over time
- Adoption rate assumptions (70-90% user acceptance)
- Processing time assumptions (5 min manual → 1 min automated)

**Sensitivity Analysis Table:**
| Field Accuracy Change | Overall Automation Impact |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| -10% per field | -40% automation rate |
| -5% per field | -22% automation rate |
| Base case | 33% automation rate |
| +5% per field | +26% automation rate |

## Industry Context Validation

### Automation Rate Ranges ✅ REALISTIC
**Framework Claims:** 30-55% automation expected
**Industry Data:** Wide variance by document type (Docsumo IDP report)
**Validation:** Treat as scenario band, not universal fact
**Recommendation:** Label as "Expected automation scenario" pending pilot validation

### Deployment Timelines ✅ CONDITIONAL
**Framework Claims:** 2-4 weeks optimal, 6-12 weeks realistic
**Validation:** Microsoft positions Syntex as fast to pilot for standard documents
**Condition:** Assumes labeled training data available and minimal governance delays
**Status:** Appropriately conditional in framework

## Action Items for Framework Completion

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. Replace any outdated Syntex pricing references with $0.005/transaction
2. Add multi-scenario ROI table with labor rate variations
3. Remove Azure setup cost claims, replace with "no mandatory fee"
4. Add explicit assumptions documentation box

### Medium Priority (Before Publication)
1. Create sensitivity analysis table for automation rates
2. Add conditional language to deployment timelines
3. Specify which services have promotional free capacity
4. Include source citations with verification dates

### Documentation Standards
- All pricing claims must include source and verification date
- All calculations must show step-by-step math for verification
- All assumptions must be explicitly stated
- All scenario outputs must be clearly labeled as estimates

**Report Date:** January 2025
**Verification Status:** Primary sources confirmed, corrections identified
**Next Review:** Update when Microsoft pricing changes or new industry data available
