## Multi-Scenario ROI Analysis (Vietnam Context)

### Labor Rate Scenarios with Source Verification

| Market Segment | Hourly Rate | Source | Monthly Equivalent | Calculation |
|----------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Vietnam Admin** | $4.35 | [2] | $697/month | $697 ÷ 160 hrs = $4.35/hr [2] |
| **Vietnam Professional** | $8-12 | [16] | $1,280-1,920/month | Regional salary data [16] |
| **Regional Professional** | $15-25 | [17] | $2,400-4,000/month | Southeast Asia averages [17] |
| **Western Contractor** | $50+ | [18] | $8,000+/month | International consulting rates [18] |

### Complete ROI Scenarios (3,000 Documents/Year)

**Manual Processing Calculation:** 3,000 docs × 5 minutes = 15,000 minutes = 250 hours [19]  
**Automated Processing Calculation:** 3,000 docs × 1 minute = 3,000 minutes = 50 hours [19]  
**Time Savings:** 200 hours annually [19]

| Scenario | Manual Processing | Automated Processing | Labor Savings | Technology Cost | Net Annual Benefit |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Vietnam Admin** | $1,087.50 [2] | $217.50 [2] | $870.00 | $30.00 [1] | **$840.00** |
| **Vietnam Professional** | $2,500.00 [16] | $500.00 [16] | $2,000.00 | $30.00 [1] | **$1,970.00** |
| **Regional Professional** | $5,000.00 [17] | $1,000.00 [17] | $4,000.00 | $30.00 [1] | **$3,970.00** |
| **Western Contractor** | $12,500.00 [18] | $2,500.00 [18] | $10,000.00 | $30.00 [1] | **$9,970.00** |

**Key Insight:** Technology cost ($30) is negligible compared to labor savings at any wage level, making ROI primarily dependent on local labor rates and document volume [20].

## Automation Rate Methodology with Sensitivity Analysis

### Formula with Explicit Assumptions

```
Overall Automation Rate = Classification Accuracy × Field Extraction Success × Adoption Rate [4]

Where:
- Classification Accuracy: Measured per document type in pilot [4]
- Field Extraction Success: ∏(Coverage_i × Precision_i) for all required fields [6]
- Adoption Rate: User acceptance factor (70-90% typical) [9]
```

### Critical Assumptions Requiring Pilot Validation

1. **Field Independence:** Assumes OCR/layout errors don't correlate across fields [6]
2. **Document Mix Consistency:** Production quality matches pilot sample [7]
3. **No Performance Drift:** Model accuracy remains stable over time [8]
4. **User Behavior:** Staff follow new automated processes consistently [9]

### Sensitivity Analysis Table

**Base Case Calculation:** [4]
- Classification accuracy: 85%
- Date field success: 90% × 85% = 76.5%
- Amount field success: 80% × 80% = 64%
- Combined field success: 76.5% × 64% = 48.96%
- Adoption rate: 80%
- Overall automation: 85% × 48.96% × 80% = 33.3%

| Field Accuracy Change | Classification Impact | Overall Automation Rate | Relative Change |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Base Case** | 85% [4] | 33.3% | - |
| **-10% per field** | 76.5% [4] | 19.8% | -40.5% |
| **-5% per field** | 80.3% [4] | 26.1% | -21.6% |
| **+5% per field** | 89.3% [4] | 42.0% | +26.1% |
| **+10% per field** | 93.5% [4] | 51.8% | +55.6% |

**Interpretation:** Small changes in field-level accuracy create large impacts on overall automation rate. Pilot testing is essential to validate assumptions [6].

## Implementation Timeline (Evidence-Based)

### Microsoft Syntex Deployment Conditions

**Optimal Timeline (2-4 weeks):** [3]
- Existing SharePoint environment properly configured [21]
- Labeled training data available (minimum 5 samples per document type) [22]
- Standard document formats (invoices, contracts, receipts) [22]
- Minimal IT governance and approval processes [3]

**Realistic Timeline (6-12 weeks):** [3]
- Custom document types requiring model training [22]
- IT security reviews and compliance approvals [23]
- User training and change management programs [9]
- Integration with existing GEMADEPT business processes [24]

**GEMADEPT-Specific Factors Adding Complexity:**
- 12 distinct document types requiring separate models [22]
- Vietnamese language content requiring validation [25]
- Logistics industry regulatory compliance [26]
- Port operations integration requirements [27]

### Phased Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Pilot Validation (6-8 weeks)** [3]
- Document collection: 185+ samples per type (2,220+ total) [28]
- Model training and initial accuracy measurement [22]
- User acceptance testing with small group [9]
- Cost and time validation against projections [19]

**Phase 2: Selective Deployment (8-12 weeks)** [3]
- Deploy to highest-ROI document types first [29]
- Establish training and support processes [9]
- Monitor adoption rates and accuracy metrics [30]
- Refine processes based on feedback [31]

**Phase 3: Full Scale (12-16 weeks)** [3]
- Complete rollout across all document types [32]
- Establish ongoing maintenance procedures [33]
- Implement performance monitoring dashboards [30]
- Plan for continuous improvement cycles [31]

## Statistical Validation Requirements

### Sample Size Calculation (Verified)

**Formula Application:** [28]
```
n = (Z² × p × (1-p)) / e²
Where: Z=1.96 (95% confidence), e=0.07 (±7% margin), p=0.5 (conservative)

Step-by-step calculation: [28]
- Z² = 1.96² = 3.8416
- p(1-p) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25
- Numerator = 3.8416 × 0.25 = 0.9604
- e² = 0.07² = 0.0049
- n = 0.9604 / 0.0049 = 196 (unadjusted)

Finite population correction (N=3,000): [28]
n_adjusted = 196 / (1 + 195/3,000) = 196 / 1.065 = 184 → 185 documents
```

**Stratified Sampling Requirements:** [34]
- Minimum 185 documents per document type for statistical validity [28]
- Quality spectrum coverage: excellent, average, and poor document samples [35]
- Temporal distribution: documents from different time periods [36]
- User variety: samples from different departments and uploaders [37]
