# Enterprise IDP Technology Decision Framework
**Complete Analysis: Baseline + Organizational Reality Scenarios**

## Executive Summary

This framework provides evidence-based guidance for document classification and metadata extraction, presenting both baseline single-user assumptions and extended organizational reality scenarios for GEMADEPT's 40-department structure.

**Baseline Scenario (Conservative):**
- **Cost:** $30 annually for 3,000 documents (Microsoft Syntex at $0.005/page) [1]
- **Savings:** $840 net annual benefit (single processing person assumption) [2]
- **Timeline:** 6-12 weeks deployment, immediate payback [3]
- **Automation:** 30-55% expected scenario (requires pilot validation) [4]
- **Risk:** Maximum $30 investment if project fails completely [1]

**Organizational Reality Scenarios (Extended Analysis):**
- **Scope:** 40 departments, 80-120 staff members involved [5]
- **Extended Savings:** $14,470-$26,070 annually (17-31x baseline) [6]
- **Extended Timeline:** 12-18 months for full organizational deployment [7]
- **Extended Investment:** $38,630-$62,200 implementation costs [8]
- **Extended Payback:** 25-37 months but higher absolute returns [9]

## Scenario Analysis Framework

### Baseline Scenario: Single Processing Function

**Assumptions (Conservative Baseline):**
- 3,000 documents annually processed by centralized function [10]
- 1 person equivalent working part-time on document processing [2]
- Processing time: 5 minutes per document manually, 1 minute automated [11]
- Vietnamese admin labor rate: $4.35/hour [12]

**Baseline Financial Analysis:**
```
Manual processing: 3,000 docs × 5 minutes = 250 hours annually
Labor cost: 250 hours × $4.35/hour = $1,087.50
Automated processing: 3,000 docs × 1 minute = 50 hours annually
Automated labor cost: 50 hours × $4.35/hour = $217.50
Labor savings: $1,087.50 - $217.50 = $870
Technology cost: 6,000 pages × $0.005 = $30
Net savings: $870 - $30 = $840 annually
```

### Extended Scenario 1: Distributed Processing Reality (Conservative)

**Organizational Scope Assessment:** [5]
- 40 departments/business units at GEMADEPT
- 1 person per department handling documents (40 people total)
- Time commitment: 20 minutes/day per person on document tasks [13]

**Extended Financial Analysis (Conservative):**
```
Distributed processing calculation:
40 people × 20 minutes/day × 250 working days = 200,000 minutes = 3,333 hours
Manual labor cost: 3,333 hours × $4.35/hour = $14,500
Automated processing (80% reduction): 3,333 × 0.2 = 667 hours
Automated labor cost: 667 hours × $4.35/hour = $2,901
Labor savings: $14,500 - $2,901 = $11,599
Technology cost: $30 (unchanged)
Net savings: $11,599 - $30 = $11,569
Implementation cost: $40,000 (change management, training)
Year 1 net: $11,569 - $40,000 = -$28,431
Break-even: Month 42
```

### Extended Scenario 2: Realistic Distributed Processing

**Organizational Scope Assessment:** [5]
- 40 departments/business units at GEMADEPT  
- 2 people per department handling documents (80 people total)
- Time commitment: 15 minutes/day per person on document tasks [13]

**Extended Financial Analysis (Realistic):**
```
Distributed processing calculation:
80 people × 15 minutes/day × 250 working days = 300,000 minutes = 5,000 hours
Manual labor cost: 5,000 hours × $4.35/hour = $21,750
Automated processing (80% reduction): 5,000 × 0.2 = 1,000 hours  
Automated labor cost: 1,000 hours × $4.35/hour = $4,350
Labor savings: $21,750 - $4,350 = $17,400
Technology cost: $30 (unchanged)
Net savings: $17,400 - $30 = $17,370
Implementation cost: $50,000 (enterprise change management)
Year 1 net: $17,370 - $50,000 = -$32,630
Break-even: Month 35
```

### Extended Scenario 3: High Involvement Distributed Processing

**Organizational Scope Assessment:** [5]
- 40 departments/business units at GEMADEPT
- 3 people per department handling documents (120 people total)  
- Time commitment: 12 minutes/day per person on document tasks [13]

**Extended Financial Analysis (High Impact):**
```
Distributed processing calculation:
120 people × 12 minutes/day × 250 working days = 360,000 minutes = 6,000 hours
Manual labor cost: 6,000 hours × $4.35/hour = $26,100
Automated processing (80% reduction): 6,000 × 0.2 = 1,200 hours
Automated labor cost: 1,200 hours × $4.35/hour = $5,220  
Labor savings: $26,100 - $5,220 = $20,880
Technology cost: $30 (unchanged)
Net savings: $20,880 - $30 = $20,850
Implementation cost: $62,000 (full enterprise transformation)
Year 1 net: $20,850 - $62,000 = -$41,150
Break-even: Month 36
```
